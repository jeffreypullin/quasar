To list all the possible options and see quasar's help you can run: ./qusar --help A normal use of quasar, providing the necessary data with all other options at their default values is: ./quasar --plink_prefix plink_prefix \\ --bed phenotype_data.bed \\ --cov covariate_data.tsv \\ --grm grm.tsv Data formats Genotype data The genotype data should be in binary plink format with .bed/.bim/.fam files named plink_prefix . Phenotype data The phenotype data is a tab-seperated file with where rows are features and the first four columns give feature inforamtion and the rest are sample ids are the sample ids.
